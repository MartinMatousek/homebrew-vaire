# MartinMatousek Vaire

*Čeština: [README.cs.md](README.cs.md)*

Homebrew tap for [Vaire](https://github.com/MartinMatousek/Vaire), an
automatic time tracker for macOS. Vaire derives worked time from Claude
Code session transcripts (`~/.claude/projects/*/*.jsonl`) and git commit
history, with manual entry and editing on top. Menu bar app + WidgetKit
widget with a daily progress ring.

## What it does

- **Tracks time automatically** from Claude Code sessions via
  `SessionStart`/`SessionEnd` hooks — no manual start/stop needed while
  you're coding with Claude Code.
- **Manual start/stop** per project from the menu bar, for work outside
  Claude Code.
- **Week view** with a resizable timeline, live/running blocks shown
  distinctly from finished ones, drag-and-drop between days, and inline
  editing of time, notes, and effort estimates.
- **Time-saved estimates** — records how long a task would have taken
  without AI, compared against actual logged time, to see the added value.
- **Menu bar progress ring** and a desktop widget showing today's hours
  against your daily target.
- **Fill day/week wizard** that walks through short days step by step,
  suggesting unlogged commits, prolonged blocks, or manual entries.
- **Timesheet upload** (optional) — semi-automatically logs your time
  into an external web-based timesheet via a Chrome window you review
  and confirm, with optional 1Password autofill for the login step.

## Install

Requires macOS 14 or later.

```
brew install --cask martinmatousek/vaire/vaire
```

Or tap first, then install:

```
brew tap martinmatousek/vaire
brew install --cask vaire
```

Or, in a `brew bundle` `Brewfile`:

```ruby
tap "martinmatousek/vaire"
cask "vaire"
```

Vaire is not notarized (no paid Apple Developer account behind it yet), so
macOS will block the first launch. To open it:

1. Try to open Vaire — Gatekeeper will refuse and offer no direct bypass.
2. Go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, scroll to the bottom,
   and click **Open Anyway** next to the Vaire warning.
3. Confirm in the dialog that appears. Vaire will launch normally from then
   on.

## Claude Code integration (optional)

The cask installs only `Vaire.app` — the CLI and hook scripts that wire
Claude Code into it live in the source repo, not the cask, so grab them
separately:

```
git clone https://github.com/MartinMatousek/Vaire.git
cd Vaire
./scripts/install_cli.sh
```

This installs `vaire` to `~/.local/bin/`. Then register these scripts
(from that same checkout) in your `~/.claude/settings.json`, with a
generous `timeout` (the SessionStart/SessionEnd hooks open VaireApp's
real note/edit windows via a `vaire://` URL and wait up to 180s for you
to act on them — 200s+ is a safe margin):

- `hooks/vaire-session-start.sh` under `SessionStart`
- `hooks/vaire-session-end.sh` under `SessionEnd`
- `hooks/vaire-stop-enforce-estimate.sh` under `Stop` (optional — nudges
  Claude to record a time-saved estimate before ending a task; skip it if
  you don't want that)

`hooks/vaire-stop-and-review.sh` isn't registered directly — it's shared
logic the other scripts source.

Hooks only track repositories you've explicitly opted in — they stay
silent for every other `cwd` instead of prompting on each session. To
enable a repository:

1. Open Vaire's Settings window.
2. Add the repository if it isn't listed yet — either it will already be
   there from a prior Claude Code session (auto-created but disabled), or
   pick its folder with **Choose…** and click **Add**.
3. Check the **Track** box next to it.

Only repositories with **Track** checked will show the SessionStart /
SessionEnd dialogs and log time. The menu bar dropdown's project list only
shows followed repositories too, each with a **Remove** link to unfollow
it (disabled while its timer is running) — equivalent to unchecking
**Track** in Settings.

## Importing from git

The Week window has an **Import from git…** button, scoped to the week
currently shown. It reads your commits in the selected project for that
week (filtered to `git config user.email`), groups them into candidate
time blocks, and opens a review sheet before writing anything — each
candidate shows its start time and an editable duration (hours/minutes,
same as everywhere else in the app), its note is editable too, and you
can uncheck any candidate you don't want. Choose whether to replace
previously git-imported blocks for that week or add alongside them.
Nothing is written until you click **Import** in the sheet. Use it to
backfill time you spent working on a project outside Claude Code — Vaire
has no other way to see that work.

## Filling a short day or week

The Week window has **Fill day…** and **Fill week…** buttons — a
guided, step-by-step way to fill a day that's under your target hours.
Each step offers one suggestion at a time: an unlogged git commit, an
existing block you can prolong (for work done after a session ended), or
a manual entry — Skip or Add & next, until the day's gap is closed or you
run out of suggestions. **Fill week…** runs the same flow across every
day in the week that isn't already at target, skipping days that are.

## Uploading time to an external timesheet

The Week window's **Upload day…** / **Upload week…** buttons can log
your time into an external web-based timesheet for you. Since that
timesheet has no API, this drives a real Chrome window instead: pair
each project with its timesheet project/task in Settings first, then
Upload fills one timesheet entry at a time in a Chrome window and pauses
before Save — you review it and click Save yourself. Nothing is ever
submitted without you looking at it first.

The Chrome window itself launches automatically, and if you enable
**1Password** autofill in Settings and pick your login item, only
approving MFA on your phone is ever needed — no password is stored by
Vaire; it's fetched from 1Password (via the `op` CLI) per attempt.
Requires:

```
brew install --cask 1password-cli
```

Then enable **Integrate with 1Password CLI** in 1Password.app → Settings
→ Developer.

The underlying automation lives in `VaireUpload/` in the source repo, not
in the cask — see
[`VaireUpload/README.md`](https://github.com/MartinMatousek/Vaire/blob/main/VaireUpload/README.md)
for the setup that needs (Node, Playwright).

## Language

Vaire's UI (app and hook dialogs) is available in English and Czech.
English is the default; switch to Czech in Settings → **Language** — the
change takes effect after restarting the app.

## Uninstalling

```
brew uninstall --cask vaire
```

Vaire's data (SQLite database, preferences) lives at
`~/Library/Application Support/Vaire/` and
`~/Library/Preferences/com.martinmatousek.vaire.app.plist` — `brew
uninstall --zap --cask vaire` removes those too.
